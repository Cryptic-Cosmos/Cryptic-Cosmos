# Cryptic Cosmos
This is a Minecraft mod (1.16.5, 1.17 support planned) focused on exploring dimensions and discovering new biomes, blocks and creatures.

There are 3 planned dimensions, but currently are only working on one - The Makrossa dimension. The Makrossa dimension is still very WIP, but it already has a lot of building blocks and decoration. There are 2 new mobs so far, with more to come!

To travel to the dimensions, use `/rift @p`, or find a rift (which will spawn around you as you explore). Enjoy!
