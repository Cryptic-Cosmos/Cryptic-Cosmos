         * Note: If you want your structure to spawn in superflat, remove the FlatChunkGenerator check
         * in StructureTutorialMain.addDimensionalSpacing and then create a superflat world, exit it,
         * and re-enter it and your structures will be spawning. I could not figure out why it needs
         * the restart but honestly, superflat is really buggy and shouldn't be your main focus in my opinion.

         * Requires AccessTransformer ( see resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg )
